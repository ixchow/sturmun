# Sturmun The Dancing Starfish

This fumblecore game about controlling a dancing starfish was made in 48 hours for LD#54 by [Jim McCann / TCHOW llc](http://tchow.com).

Play by pressing `q`, `w`, `e`, `a`, and `d` to grow the Sturmun's limbs. Guide it to the stars to beat each level. Sturmun will grow as it touches more stars.

Alternative play mode: listen to hardbass music and make Sturmun dance!

## Level Editing

Levels are exported from svg files by the `levels/make-levels.py` script, called from `levels/Makefile` (which also compiles the levels into a single `levels.js` file).
